/** 
 * An interface representing a text message.
 * <p>
 * This is a subinterface of {@link Message Message} which contains methods to
 * get and set the text payload. The
 * {@link #setPayloadText(String) setPayloadText} method sets the value of the
 * payload in the data container without any checking whether the value is valid
 * in any way. Methods for manipulating the address portion of the message are
 * inherited from <code>Message</code>.
 * <p>
 * Object instances implementing this interface are just containers for the data
 * that is passed in. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Character Encoding Considerations</h3>
 * <p>Text messages using this interface
 * deal with <code>String</code>s encoded in Java.
 * The underlying implementation will convert the
 * <code>String</code>s into a suitable encoding for the messaging
 * protocol in question. Different protocols recognize different character 
 * sets. To ensure that characters are transmitted 
 * correctly across the network, an application should use the 
 * character set(s) recognized by the protocol.
 * If an application is unaware of the protocol, or uses a 
 * character set that the protocol does not recognize, then some characters 
 * might be transmitted incorrectly. 
 * </p>
